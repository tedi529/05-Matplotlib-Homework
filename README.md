  In this analysis, we looked at the potential effects of different drugs on cancer development in mice based on experiments conducted by a pharmaceutical company. 
  Based upon the results of the analysis, of the three drugs (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril) examined, Capomulin was the only drug that performed better than the placebo in reducing tumor size for the duration of the treatment, with a 19% decrease. 
  The fewest metastatic sites formed during the treatment with Capomulin.
  Capomulin had the lowest mice death rate among the drugs examined. 
  Based on these results alone, Capomulin should be the drug chosen to treat this type of carcinoma.
